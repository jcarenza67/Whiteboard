Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. 
There are many different sorting algorithms — 
take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

bubble sort:

function sortArray(arr) {
  let length = arr.length;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < length - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        let temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
